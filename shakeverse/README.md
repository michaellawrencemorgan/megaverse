# ShakeVerse App

A simple React Native app that displays random King James Version scripture verses whenever the user shakes their phone. The verses are stored locally in `verses.json` so the app works offline.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. Start the app with `expo start` or run the project in your preferred React Native environment.
3. Shake your device (or use the emulator's shake gesture) to display a new verse.

The scripture verses used are from the public domain King James Version of the Bible.
