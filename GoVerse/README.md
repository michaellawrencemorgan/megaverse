# GoVerse Replica

This directory contains a minimal example of an iOS application that replicates the basic functionality of a "GoVerse" style app. It shows Bible verses over background images and allows users to swipe to change the verse or image. The code uses several popular open source frameworks.

## Features
- Display a verse with a topic header.
- Swipe left/right to change verses.
- Swipe up/down to change background images.
- Example integration with `Alamofire` for fetching verses from a remote source.
- Example usage of `SnapKit` for UI layout.
- Placeholder code for uploading images and exchanging scriptures.

This code is a simplified skeleton intended as a starting point. You will need to create an Xcode project, add the provided Swift files, and configure the dependencies using CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager.

## Dependencies
The sample references the following open source libraries (all available under permissive licenses):
- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for networking.
- [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) for programmatic Auto Layout.
- [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) for JSON parsing.
- [NotificationBannerSwift](https://github.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner) for banner notifications.

You can include additional libraries from the list provided in the prompt as needed.

## Bible Translations
The application is designed to work with various Bible translations (AMP, ESV, NIV, etc.). Make sure you comply with the respective licenses when distributing verse text. The sample code loads verses from a JSON file or a remote API.
